This is the beginning of an automated financial model.

Phase I - Creating the Financial model for Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST)
Phase II - collect and fetch the required Edgar inputs using Edgar API
Phase III - using Python or VBA macro, automatically update the values in the financial model from phase I

Current status - Financial Model almost ready and Edgar API script has been prepared.

Next Steps - collect the ids that are required to be updated manually in the finacial model.
